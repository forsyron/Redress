## Enabling Affordable Clean Energy

The REDRESS 'container generator' concept stands as a beacon of affordable clean energy. As mass manufacturing takes center stage, the transition to cleaner energy will seamlessly blend into everyday Australian life. But how will this transition be realized?

Thankfully, the size of the REDRESS container generator permits on-site installation at customer premises. Post-sunset, the common recourse for most customers is purchasing energy from the local network. However, this often entails costs of at least 20c/kWh, reaching even higher on time-of-use network tariffs. Enter the REDRESS 'container generator,' a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to network energy purchase.

Initially, these generators will find their niche where customers have no viable alternative to network energy procurement after sundown, especially in areas where electricity costs are exorbitant. The scope will swiftly expand, encompassing regions lacking network supply in Australia and developing nations in Asia and Africa. This diversified market will propel generator development to a commercial scale.

Subsequently, our focus pivots to cost reduction. Design refinements and automated manufacturing will drive down expenses. The ultimate goal: energy costs from container generators that rival gas turbine-generated power, hovering around 10c/kWh. With this milestone, Australia can fully embrace a dependable, cost-efficient clean energy future, leaving fossil fuels behind.
