# New Engine Innovation

The Cornerstone of Affordable Clean Energy

The heart of REDRESS's breakthrough in cost-efficient clean energy lies in the revolutionary rotary hot-air engine, a departure from conventional steam turbines. But what exactly is a hot-air engine?

Historically, 'hot-air engines' referred to a class of engines developed in the 19th century. Powered by coal, these engines harnessed heated air instead of steam as their operating medium. They evolved into the internal combustion engines of today, with combustion shifted from within to outside the engine.

The REDRESS hot-air engine is a modernized iteration of a once-challenged concept. Through meticulous development and contemporary materials, it stands poised to be the ideal engine for converting solar thermal energy into renewable power. This engine promises a solar-to-electrical conversion increase of 50%-100% compared to steam turbines. The result: significantly reduced cost per kWh of clean energy.

By substituting steam turbines with the advanced hot-air engine, the conversion efficiency of solar thermal energy into electrical energy surges from 15%-18% to 25%-30% or potentially higher. This transformative engine is projected to slash energy costs by 28%-50%, contingent on engine expenses.

The new engine heralds a paradigm shift in CST generation, propelling us toward an era of economical and sustainable energy.
