# Storage: The Affordable Advantage

Accelerating Clean Energy Transition with Affordable Storage

In the quest for a swift and successful shift to clean energy, affordability in storage holds the key. While battery costs are gradually declining, the pace isn't swift enough to propel a mass transition to energy storage. Australia, like many nations, grapples with an energy storage crisis amid its clean energy journey.

Australia's abundant sunlight makes solar energy highly accessible, reflected in its high solar cell adoption rate. However, the challenge arises as excessive solar energy strains the supply system, necessitating temporary shutdowns. With affordable battery storage, excess energy could be stored for later use, mitigating this challenge. Urgently needed is accessible and swift storage. Could thermal storage be the solution?

In a word, yes. Thermal storage offers a viable solution. It's proven, cost-effective, and REDRESS technology promises to drive its cost down further. To illustrate the economic viability of thermal storage over battery storage, we present a comparative cost analysis in US Dollars (USD) due to industry convention.

## The Financial Edge of Thermal Storage:

Thermal storage shines in most Australian contexts as it capitalizes on storing solar energy as heatâ€”a cost-effective endeavor. Various thermal storage options are available around USD 25/kWh or less. In stark contrast, lithium-ion battery storage costs range from USD 280/kWh for large-scale utilities to USD 800/kWh for domestic use. Storing electrical energy in batteries is thus about 12 to 30 times costlier than storing solar energy as heat.

Yet, to genuinely compare these storage methods, we must incorporate the efficiency of the engine converting heat into electricity. Steam-based CST generators, often boasting 15%-18% efficiency, require around 6 units of heat energy to generate 1 unit of clean electricity. For simplification, let's assume 6 units of solar thermal energy generate 1 unit of clean electricity.

Incorporating turbine efficiency and heat storage cost, the cost to store heat for generating 1 unit of clean electricity equates to 6x USD 25/kWh, approximately USD 150/kWh. With battery storage costs ranging USD 280/kWh to USD 800/kWh, clean energy storage through batteries is 2 to 5 times pricier than thermal storage.

However, the REDRESS technology introduces a transformative edge. This advanced engine is projected to be at least 50% more efficient than its steam turbine counterpart. With REDRESS's efficiency enhancement, thermal storage's cost is anticipated to drop to USD 100/kWh or lower. Battery storage's cost disparity then widens to 3 to 7.5 times more expensive than thermal storage utilizing REDRESS technology.

Clearly, thermal storage holds a significant cost advantage over battery storage. Furthermore, its cost-efficiency could elevate further with enhanced heat-to-energy conversion via the advanced REDRESS engine. Given the pressing need for substantial clean energy storage to expedite a transition to a greener future, Australia's answer seems evident: thermal storage in various forms, providing an affordable alternative to substantially pricier battery storage.
