## **Executive Summary:**

Introducing **REDRESS**, a revolutionary hybrid biomass and solar thermal (*HyBAST*) storage technology. It offers a cost-effective solution for achieving **100% renewable energy** without costly battery storage. REDRESS stands out for its adaptability to various clean energy sources, utilization of a cutting-edge rotary hot air engine, efficient factory manufacturing, and quick on-site installation. This innovation could reshape Australia's clean energy landscape.

## Project Mission Statement

Mission Statement:
We are dedicated to advancing the energy landscape by creating a storage solution that:

* Enables over 100 hours of uninterrupted renewable energy generation
* Initial kWh cost outperforms grid rates
* Aims to achieve cost parity with traditional generators

Together, let's shape a greener future through innovative energy storage.

## **Advantages:**

* Powered by multiple clean energy sources for up to **100% supply security**.
* Cost-effective alternative to other storage options, especially in *long-duration* applications.
* Ideal for *businesses*, *rural properties*, *remote communities*, and more, offering lower-cost energy.
* Replaces diesel generators, enhancing sustainability in various settings.
* Ensures *reliability* and *resilience*.
* Can provide energy security services to the *National Energy Market (NEM)*.

## **Issues**

* Identifying issues and offering solutions is a very persuasive.

## **Resources:**

REDRESS generators are constructed from common materials, primarily *steel and glass*, without hazardous substances. They're fully assembled in factories and then transported to sites, where installation takes just *2-3 days* with minimal environmental impact.
