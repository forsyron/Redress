## Pioneering Sustainable Energy: The REDRESS Vision

The foundation of REDRESS technology is rooted in concentrated solar thermal (CST), a proven approach to generating and storing renewable energy. Dating back to Augustin Mouchot's 1866 breakthrough, CST harnesses solar energy through thermal storage, driving a steam engine. As clean energy adoption intensifies, affordable energy storage gains paramount importance. The resurgence of CST stems from its cost-effectiveness compared to battery storage, making it a compelling solution.

Conventional CST shares similarities with coal-fired generation, substituting solar energy for coal. If not for higher costs attributed to pricier solar energy and storage, traditional CST could be an optimal solution for clean energy in Australia.

In contrast to solar cells and batteries, CST maintains several advantages:

1. **Cost Efficiency:** With increased storage, CST becomes about 50% more economical than solar cells and batteries.
2. **Fuel Flexibility:** CST can utilize supplementary renewable fuels (e.g., biomass, biogas) for base-load generation during solar energy depletion.
3. **Waste Heat Innovation:** Waste heat from generators holds potential for manufacturing additional bio-fuels.

However, the challenge lies in the cost disparity between traditional CST and coal/gas generation, deterring CST's widespread Australian usage.

REDRESS's core objective is twofold:

1. **Enhanced Efficiency:** Maintain CST's benefits while substantially reducing energy costs, aligning with coal and gas generator rates. Achieved by replacing steam turbines with a more efficient hot air engine.
2. **Size Innovation:** Downsize CST generators for on-site installation, enabling customers to generate and store energy at lower costs than network purchase.

REDRESS envisions a future where renewable energy is genuinely accessible and affordable, benefiting not only Australians but also millions in sunlit regions worldwide.
