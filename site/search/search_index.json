The REDRESS technology has huge potential both for Australia and other sunny parts of the world to transition to renewable energy at the lowest cost possible. The REDRESS technology is based on the established concentrated solar thermal (CST) approach to generating and storing renewable energy. Steam-based CST generation and thermal storage technology is already substantially cheaper than solar cells and batteries, but the energy from steam based CST is still around 12c/kWh to 18c/kWh - about 50% more expensive than energy generated using fossil fuels. The new REDRESS technology will substantially reduce that price gap, with the ultimate aim being to generate and store renewable energy for about the same cost as generating dirty energy using natural gas in gas turbines. REDRESS is taking a radical and unique approach to achieve that goal. The REDRESS approach is unique in several ways It is unique in that it uses a new and efficient rotary hot-air engine to convert the stored solar thermal energy into electricity. The new engine converts more of the concentrated solar energy into electrical energy than does the conventional steam turbine. The new engine will therefore increase the solar-to-electricity conversion factor, resulting in a significantly lower cost per kWh of the clean energy it produces. It is unique in that the power output of the new engine is much smaller than it would be with a steam turbine. The smaller power output of the engine means that the engine is suitable for use in generators small enough to be installed at a customer's premises. The result is that customers will soon be able to both generate and store their own clean energy at much lower cost than using solar cells and batteries. It is unique in that the REDRESS approach will enable manufacturers to fully assemble the modular generators in a factory from where they will be easily delivered to site. It is unique in that the only on-site work required to commission the generator will be the preparation of a flat piece of ground onto which to locate the generator housing, the installation of the solar collectors on top of the generator housing, and minor electrical works to commission the generator. It is unique in that the generator is designed to (ultimately) be mass-manufactured in fully automated factories so as to reduce the future cost of generating and storing renewable energy to the absolute minimum. The new REDRESS micro-generator technology is a radical departure from all current options for generating and storing renewable energy. It is suitable for installation at small business/industrial premises where it will generate and store renewable energy at a lower cost than energy purchased from the network. It is equally suitable for large business/industrial installations where multiple generators will combine to provide a genuine and economical renewable energy solution for Australia\u2019s energy needs into the future. Ultimately the REDRESS technology is expected to generate renewable energy 24/7 at a cost comparable to the current cost of wholesale electricity in the National Energy Market.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"The new REDRESS technology is the breakthrough Australia needs to transition to 100% affordable renewable energy without the need for expensive battery storage.

Dating back to Augustin Mouchot's 1866 breakthrough, CST harnesses solar energy through thermal storage, driving a steam engine. As clean energy adoption intensifies, affordable energy storage gains paramount importance. The resurgence of CST stems from its cost-effectiveness compared to battery storage, making it a compelling solution. Conventional CST shares similarities with coal-fired generation, substituting solar energy for coal. If not for higher costs attributed to pricier solar energy and storage, traditional CST could be an optimal solution for clean energy in Australia. In contrast to solar cells and batteries, CST maintains several advantages: Cost Efficiency: With increased storage, CST becomes about 50% more economical than solar cells and batteries. Fuel Flexibility: CST can utilize supplementary renewable fuels (e.g., biomass, biogas) for base-load generation during solar energy depletion. Waste Heat Innovation: Waste heat from generators holds potential for manufacturing additional bio-fuels. However, the challenge lies in the cost disparity between traditional CST and coal/gas generation, deterring CST's widespread Australian usage. REDRESS's core objective is twofold: Enhanced Efficiency: Maintain CST's benefits while substantially reducing energy costs, aligning with coal and gas generator rates. Achieved by replacing steam turbines with a more efficient hot air engine. Size Innovation: Downsize CST generators for on-site installation, enabling customers to generate and store energy at lower costs than network purchase.

While battery costs are gradually declining, the pace isn't swift enough to propel a mass transition to energy storage. Australia, like many nations, grapples with an energy storage crisis amid its clean energy journey. Australia's abundant sunlight makes solar energy highly accessible, reflected in its high solar cell adoption rate. However, the challenge arises as excessive solar energy strains the supply system, necessitating temporary shutdowns. With affordable battery storage, excess energy could be stored for later use, mitigating this challenge. Urgently needed is accessible and swift storage. Could thermal storage be the solution? In a word, yes. Thermal storage offers a viable solution. It's proven, cost-effective, and REDRESS technology promises to drive its cost down further. To illustrate the economic viability of thermal storage over battery storage, we present a comparative cost analysis in US Dollars (USD) due to industry convention. The Financial Edge of Thermal Storage: Thermal storage shines in most Australian contexts as it capitalizes on storing solar energy as heat\u2014a cost-effective endeavor. Various thermal storage options are available around USD 25/kWh or less. In stark contrast, lithium-ion battery storage costs range from USD 280/kWh for large-scale utilities to USD 800/kWh for domestic use. Storing electrical energy in batteries is thus about 12 to 30 times costlier than storing solar energy as heat. Yet, to genuinely compare these storage methods, we must incorporate the efficiency of the engine converting heat into electricity. Steam-based CST generators, often boasting 15%-18% efficiency, require around 6 units of heat energy to generate 1 unit of clean electricity. For simplification, let's assume 6 units of solar thermal energy generate 1 unit of clean electricity. Incorporating turbine efficiency and heat storage cost, the cost to store heat for generating 1 unit of clean electricity equates to 6x USD 25/kWh, approximately USD 150/kWh. With battery storage costs ranging USD 280/kWh to USD 800/kWh, clean energy storage through batteries is 2 to 5 times pricier than thermal storage. However, the REDRESS technology introduces a transformative edge. This advanced engine is projected to be at least 50% more efficient than its steam turbine counterpart. With REDRESS's efficiency enhancement, thermal storage's cost is anticipated to drop to USD 100/kWh or lower. Battery storage's cost disparity then widens to 3 to 7.5 times more expensive than thermal storage utilizing REDRESS technology. Clearly, thermal storage holds a significant cost advantage over battery storage. Furthermore, its cost-efficiency could elevate further with enhanced heat-to-energy conversion via the advanced REDRESS engine.
